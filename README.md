All my dirty scripts, and I can't insist more on the term "dirty", are provided for convenience. There's no context and it's on purpose.

Indeed, **the idea is not give you a full writeup**.

Besides, you will likely find some ways to improve the code, as the idea is to get the desired information quick, but during a CTF, it's hard to produce the perfect script.
